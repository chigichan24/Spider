</div>

## Background
[AGSL](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/agsl) is a shader that defines the behavior of programmable shader objects.
When we use the AGSL, passing the raw string directly. It has a potential of runtime crash.
Spider will care that situations.

## Usage
TBD

## Plan

- [x] Annotation for enum support
- [ ] Annotation with args support
- [ ] Pre syntax verify support
